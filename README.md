# Simple-Countdown
This will allow you to display a countdown to a specified date on any of your Pixel Overlay models. Typically this will be a matrix or other high density prop.
No other Plugin is required.
You can also configure the plug in to display a message when the date/time has been reached or have it start counting up.
The Simple Countdown can also send the message to a different FPP device and that device does not need the plugin installed.
